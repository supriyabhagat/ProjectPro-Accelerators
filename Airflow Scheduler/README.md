# Let's say you have a data pipeline that needs to be executed on a daily basis. This pipeline involves the following steps:

1. Extract data from a MySQL database
2. Clean and transform the data using Python
3. Load the data into a PostgreSQL database
4. Send a notification email to stakeholders when the pipeline is complete

# You could implement this pipeline using Airflow in the following way:

1. Define a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in Airflow, with each step of the pipeline as a separate task.
2. Set up a MySQL connection and a PostgreSQL connection in Airflow, and use these connections to extract and load data.
3. Write a Python script to clean and transform the data, and use a PythonOperator in Airflow to execute this script as a task.
4. Use an EmailOperator in Airflow to send a notification email when the pipeline is complete.


In the given example, the `MySqlOperator`, `PythonOperator`, `PostgresOperator`, and `EmailOperator` tasks correspond to the four steps in the pipeline described above. The `MySqlOperator` and `PostgresOperator` tasks use connections to MySQL and PostgreSQL databases that have been set up in Airflow, respectively. The `PythonOperator` task executes a Python callable that performs the data cleaning and transformation. The `EmailOperator` task sends a notification email to a stakeholder. Finally, the >> operator is used to define the dependencies between tasks, so that each task is executed in the correct order.

The given function takes in three parameters:

1. `mysql_conn_id`: the ID of the MySQL connection to use (as defined in Airflow)
2. `postgres_conn_id`: the ID of the PostgreSQL connection to use (as defined in Airflow)
3. `email_to`: the email address to send the notification to

It returns an instance of the DAG, which can then be added to an Airflow environment for scheduling and execution.

## Where do we get `mysql_conn_id` from?
In the Airflow DAG definition, mysql_conn_id is used to identify the MySQL connection that should be used to extract data from the MySQL database.

In Airflow, connections are reusable configurations that describe how to connect to an external system, such as a database or a message queue. By defining a connection, you can store the connection information securely in the Airflow metadata database and reuse it across DAGs.

To create a new MySQL connection in Airflow, you can follow these steps:

1. In the Airflow UI, go to the Admin section and click on "Connections".
2. Click the "+ Add a new record" button.
3. In the form that appears, fill in the following fields:
    * Conn Id: a unique identifier for the connection, such as my_mysql_connection
    * Conn Type: select "MySQL" from the dropdown
    * Host: the hostname or IP address of the MySQL server
    * Schema: the name of the MySQL database to connect to
    * Login: the MySQL username to use
    * Password: the MySQL password to use
    * Port: the port number to connect to (usually 3306)
4. Click the "Save" button to create the connection.

Once you have created the connection, you can use the mysql_conn_id parameter in your DAG code to specify which connection to use for a given task.


## Where do we get `postgres_conn_id` from?
In the Airflow DAG definition, postgres_conn_id is used to identify the PostgreSQL connection that should be used to load data into a PostgreSQL database.

In Airflow, connections are reusable configurations that describe how to connect to an external system, such as a database or a message queue. By defining a connection, you can store the connection information securely in the Airflow metadata database and reuse it across DAGs.

To create a new PostgreSQL connection in Airflow, you can follow these steps:

1. In the Airflow UI, go to the Admin section and click on "Connections".
2. Click the "+ Add a new record" button.
3. In the form that appears, fill in the following fields:
    * Conn Id: a unique identifier for the connection, such as my_postgres_connection
    * Conn Type: select "Postgres" from the dropdown
    * Host: the hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server
    * Schema: the name of the PostgreSQL database to connect to
    * Login: the PostgreSQL username to use
    * Password: the PostgreSQL password to use
    * Port: the port number to connect to (usually 5432)
4. Click the "Save" button to create the connection.
Once you have created the connection, you can use the postgres_conn_id parameter in your DAG code to specify which connection to use for a given task.


## How to configure `email_to` using Airflow UI?

In the Airflow DAG definition, email_to is the email address of the recipient who should receive the email notification when the DAG fails.

To set up email notifications in Airflow, you need to configure the smtp section in your airflow.cfg file with your SMTP server details. Once you have done that, you can use the EmailOperator to send emails from your DAGs.

To create a new email connection in Airflow, you can follow these steps:

In the Airflow UI, go to the Admin section and click on "Connections".
Click the "+ Add a new record" button.
In the form that appears, fill in the following fields:
Conn Id: a unique identifier for the connection, such as my_email_connection
Conn Type: select "SMTP" from the dropdown
Host: the hostname or IP address of your SMTP server
Login: the username to use for authentication (if required)
Password: the password to use for authentication (if required)
Port: the port number to use for the SMTP server (usually 25, 465 or 587)
Secure: select the type of security to use for the SMTP connection (if required)
Timeout: the timeout value to use for the SMTP connection (in seconds)
Extras: any extra parameters to pass to the smtplib.SMTP constructor (if required)
From: the email address to use as the sender in the email headers
Test Email: an email address to use for testing the connection (optional)
Click the "Save" button to create the connection.
Once you have created the connection, you can use the EmailOperator or EmailHook to send emails from your DAGs.
